<h1>Introduction</h1>
<div class="intro"><p>This form is an opportunity for introductions as well as a demonstration of PHP and JavaScript in a reasonably usable, sticky form. This class covers all the elements it takes to build this form. I am counting on you having enough HTML and CSS to follow what we cover in this class. </p><p>By the end of the class you will build a three page site that is a portfolio builder because it demonstrates your skills. Your form will have the same fields as this so that you can follow the functions we build and how we pass the data. Everything else is up to you. Make your own storyline. If you are comfortable going deeper into the languages that's great!</p><p>Please do not format it exactly like mine. This is an opportunity to practice and demonstrate your design skills while learning these new languages.</p><p>One of the most important points in any portfolio piece is the attribution of artwork. So all images <em><b>MUST HAVE source credit even if you own it.</b></em> This picture is of me and I own it. Feel free to put your image credits in the footer.</p></div></div>

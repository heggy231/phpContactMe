<h1>Introduction</h1>
<div class="intro"><p>This is a capstone project which demonstrates my practical knowledge of PHP and JavaScript in a usable, sticky form. The PHP and JavaSript course from UCSC covers all the elements it takes to build this form. </p><p>This capstone project, ContactMe is a three page site that is part of my portfolio because it demonstrates my working knowledge and skills.</p><p>This project gave me an excellent opportunity to practice and demonstrate my design skills while learning these new languages.</p><p>I believe that one of the most important points in any portfolio piece is the attribution of artwork. So all images <em><b>HAVE source credit even if I own it.</b></em> Please check out my image credits in the footer.</p></div></div>
